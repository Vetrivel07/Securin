# Declaring values directly

for i in A:
    for j in B:
        # Calculate the sum for each combinations 
        sum = i + j
        # Update in dictionary dis
        if sum in dis:

            dis[sum] = 1
print("Distribution of Combinations:")
for sum, comb in dis.items():
    print(f"The Sum {sum} has occurred in {comb} combinations")

#explanation:
#The above Python code calculates the distribution of all possible combinations by iterating through each pair of faces on both dies, I have created the dictionary "dis" and updating the sum value accordingly to keep track of the combination of each sum. Thus, in the end I printed the sum and number of combinations has occurred for that sum in the end.
