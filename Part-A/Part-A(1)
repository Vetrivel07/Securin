# Declaring values directly
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]     
# Declaring values using a for loop
B=[i  for i in range(1,7)]
# Calculate the total combinations
tc = len(A) * len(B)
print("Total Combinations:", tc)

#explanation
#Thus, the above Python code defines the faces on each die in a list format and then calculates the total number of combinations by multiplying the lengths of the two lists and in the end, it will print the result value which is “36”.
